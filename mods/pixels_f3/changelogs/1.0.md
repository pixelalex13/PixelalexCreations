## Additions

- A custom overlay that’s a cleaner version of the F3 screen, showing only important debug information.
- A new keybind, “Toggle F3 HUD”, in the Misc category that defaults to C and activates the overlay when pressed.
- A config file that lets you change the overlay color and transparency using an RGBA hex color value.
