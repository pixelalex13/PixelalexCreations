## Additions

- An Invisible Name Tag crafted using an invisibility potion and a name tag, that when worn on the head disables the players name tag and makes him disappear from the locator bar
- An Name Tag Visibility attribute with the standard value of 1.0 and when changed to 0.0 disables the target players name tag

**Note:**
- The Invisible Name Tag crafting recipe is hard coded, because it uses the invisibility potion and therefore wont show up in the recipe book
